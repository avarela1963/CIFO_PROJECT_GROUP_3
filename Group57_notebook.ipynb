        "\n",
        "The price of a used car is influenced by multiple factors such as age, mileage, brand, fuel type, and technical characteristics, making accurate price estimation a complex task. The objective of this project is to develop a consistent model assessment strategy that allows the creation and comparison of different candidate regression models in order to identify the most generalizable one for predicting car prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "The work started with an exploratory analysis of the dataset to understand feature distributions and identify data quality issues. A major challenge during data preparation was the cleaning of categorical variables, particularly brand and model names, which contained numerous inconsistencies and misspellings. To address this, a hybrid fuzzy string matching approach was applied, combining Euclidean distance and Levenshtein distance to standardise equivalent values. Missing data was handled using appropriate imputation methods, while numerical features were scaled and categorical features were encoded. The dataset was split into training and test sets, with all model training, comparison, and hyperparameter tuning performed exclusively on the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In total, six different regression models were developed and evaluated using a consistent assessment strategy, enabling a fair comparison of their performance and generalisation capability. The best results, in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), were achieved using a blended model combining Extra Trees, Random Forest, and Histogram Gradient Boosting. In addition, an analytics interface was created using Gradio, allowing users to input new vehicle data and instantly receive a predicted price from the trained model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future work may focus on feature engineering, expanding the dataset, and improving the user interface to make it more user-friendly and robust.\n"
